SmartSoccerTracker

This project aims to track, store, and analyze detailed performance data for players in the world’s top three soccer leagues — the English Premier League, La Liga, and Serie A. It is designed for coaches, analysts, and fans who want to monitor and compare player performance and match statistics throughout the season.

The goal of this repository is to collect and analyze data on goals, assists, passes, tackles, interceptions, and overall player ratings, providing a centralized and user-friendly resource for performance insights. The program will include data logging tools, visual dashboards, and analytical features that help users identify trends, compare players, and evaluate match outcomes.

If successfully executed, the tracker will allow users to search for their favorite players and view their up-to-date match statistics, creating an interactive and data-driven soccer experience.
